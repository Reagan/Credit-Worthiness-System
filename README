CREDIT WORTHINESS SYSTEM (vs 0.1)

Objective
#########
This system will ensure that shopkeepers do not give out more stuff on credit than the credit limit for a particular user should be. It thus reduces the likelihood that a shopkeeper selling on credit does not make a loss.

Features
#########
The system includes a number of features including: 

	1. User Inventory and Management system that allows the creation of new user details and the editing of those user details
	2. Transactions Management for users/customers allowing the shop keeper to view the dates, items, worth and other details of the transactions made by a user
	3. Custom chart component that allows the shopkeeper to easily see if he/she is making a loss or a profit
	4. Printing modules to allow the shop keeper to print out the pending transaction item logs and all transactions for all users

Development
############
The system is developed in Java SE and runs on a MySQL db. Installation instructions are available in the INSTALLATION file
